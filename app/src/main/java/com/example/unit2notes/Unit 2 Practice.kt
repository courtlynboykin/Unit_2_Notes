//1. Mobile notifications
//Typically, your phone provides you with a summary of notifications.
//
//In the initial code provided in the following code snippet, write a program that prints the summary message based on the number of notifications that you received. The message should include:
//
//The exact number of notifications when there are less than 100 notifications.
//99+ as the number of notifications when there are 100 notifications or more.
//
//Complete the printNotificationSummary() function so that the program prints these lines:
//
//
//You have 51 notifications.
//Your phone is blowing up! You have 99+ notifications.

//2. Movie tickets are typically priced differently based on the age of moviegoers.
//
//In the initial code provided in the following code snippet, write a program that calculates these age-based ticket prices:
//
//A children's ticket price of $15 for people 12 years old or younger.
//A standard ticket price of $30 for people between 13 and 60 years old. On Mondays, discount the standard ticket price to $25 for this same age group.
//A senior ticket price of $20 for people 61 years old and older. Assume that the maximum age of a moviegoer is 100 years old.
//A -1 value to indicate that the price is invalid when a user inputs an age outside of the age specifications

//Kelvin to Celsius: 째 C = K - 273.15
//Fahrenheit to Kelvin: K = 5/9 (째 F - 32) + 273.15

//imagine that you need to create a music-player app.

//
//Properties for the title, artist, year published, and play count
//A property that indicates whether the song is popular. If the play count is less than 1,000, consider it unpopular.

//6. Internet profile
//Oftentimes, you're required to complete profiles for online websites that contain mandatory and non-mandatory fields. For example, you can add your personal information and link to other people who referred you to sign up for the profile.
//
//In the initial code provided in the following code snippet, write a program which prints out a person's profile details.

//Foldable phones
//Typically, a phone screen turns on and off when the power button is pressed. In contrast, if a foldable phone is folded, the main inner screen on a foldable phone doesn't turn on when the power button is pressed.
//
//In the initial code provided in the following code snippet, write a FoldablePhone class that inherits from the Phone class. It should contain the following:
//
//A property that indicates whether the phone is folded.
//A different switchOn() function behavior than the Phone class so that it only turns the screen on when the phone isn't folded.
//Methods to change the folding state.
open class Phone(var isScreenLightOn: Boolean = false){

//Typically in an auction, the highest bidder determines the price of an item. In this special auction, if there's no bidder for an item, the item is automatically sold to the auction house at the minimum price.
//
//In the initial code provided in the following code snippet, you're given an auctionPrice() function that accepts a nullable Bid? type as an argument:

//Elvis operator
fun main() {
    val winningBid = Bid(5000, "Private Collector")

    println("Item A is sold at ${auctionPrice(winningBid, 2000)}.")
    println("Item B is sold at ${auctionPrice(null, 3000)}.")
